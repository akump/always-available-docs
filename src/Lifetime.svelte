<h1>How To Sign Up for Lifetime</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    The lifetime subscription requires Venmo/Cash App. Venmo/Cash App $20 to
    either account with your email as a note. Then, you will be able to login,
    and use the extension forever.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cash App: $AndrewKump</li>
    <li>Venmo: Andrew-Kump-2</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Next, I will add you to the list of Lifetime users. This requires me
    manually adding you. I will do this ASAP, and email you when completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, you can login in the Lifetime column within the settings popup and
    enjoy all features.
